__VueFront__ is a <a href="//vuejs.org">VueJS powered</a> CMS agnostic SPA & PWA frontend for your old-fashioned Blog and E-commerce site. 

__PrestaShop__ is an efficient and innovative e-commerce solution with all the features you need to create an online store and grow your business.

__CMS Connect App__ - adds the connection between the PrestaShop CMS and VueFront Web App via a GraphQL API.

## What does it do?
This is a PrestaShop module that connects the PrestaShop CMS with the VueFront Web App via a GraphQL API. When installed, you will be provided with a CMS Connect URL that you will add to your VueFront Web App during [setup](https://vuefront.com/guide/setup.html).

## DEMO

[VueFront on PrestaShop](https://prestashop.vuefront.com/)

### PrestaShop Blog (PrestaBlog) 
Since PrestaShop does not have a built-in Blog, we use [PrestaBlog](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/blog-forum-new/4731-professional-blog.html) to add blog support. If PrestaBlog is not avalible, VueFront will ignore it.

## How to install?
Php version required >= 5.5, <= 7.2 (this limitation will be removed in the future)

### Quick Install
1. The quickest way to install is via PrestaShop Module Manager or manually [Download](https://github.com/vuefront/prestashop/releases) the **compiled** module and upload it through the 'Modules > Module Manager > Upload a module' menu in PrestaShop
2. Activate the Module after installation is complete
3. Visit modules's configurations to get the CMS Connect URL

You will need the CMS Connect URL to complete the [VueFront Web App installation](https://vuefront.com/guide/setup.html)
